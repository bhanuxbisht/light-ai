## 🚀 Next Steps: Day 3-4

**Focus**: Build Problems API

### Endpoints to Build:
1. `GET /api/problems` - List problems with filters (difficulty, pattern, company, search)
2. `GET /api/problems/:slug` - Get single problem with all details
3. `POST /api/problems/:slug/submit` - Execute code and save submission
4. `GET /api/problems/:slug/submissions` - Get user's submission history
5. `POST /api/problems/:slug/bookmark` - Toggle bookmark
6. `GET /api/problems/:slug/hints` - Progressive hint reveal
7. `GET /api/problems/daily` - Get daily challenge

### Requirements:
- Pagination (20 problems per page)
- Filtering by difficulty, pattern, company, status
- Search functionality
- XP calculation on submission
- Progress tracking integration

## 💾 Database Stats

```sql
-- Total problems: 50
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM problems;
-- Result: 50

-- By difficulty
SELECT difficulty, COUNT(*) FROM problems GROUP BY difficulty;
-- Easy: 14, Medium: 33, Hard: 3

-- By pattern
SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM problems GROUP BY category;
-- Distributed across all 10 patterns

-- Languages check
SELECT jsonb_object_keys(starter_code) as languages FROM problems LIMIT 1;
-- Result: javascript, python, java, cpp, c
```

## ✨ Day 2 Summary

**Started**: 10 problems, 2 languages (40% complete)
**Ended**: 50 problems, 5 languages (100% complete)

**Time Investment**: ~2 hours
**Files Modified**: 3 new SQL files
**Commits**: 1 commit (8bda8b4)
**Database Inserts**: 40 new problems + 10 updates

**Result**: MVP problem database ready for API development! 🎉

## 🎓 What We Learned

1. **JSONB is powerful** - Storing test cases and starter code as JSONB allows flexibility
2. **Pattern distribution** - Balanced coverage across all 10 DSA patterns
3. **Multi-language support** - Template approach works well for code starters
4. **SQL efficiency** - Batch inserts with transactions are fast
5. **Git workflow** - Clean commits make progress tracking easy
